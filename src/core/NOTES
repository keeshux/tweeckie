WARNING: $.ajax call in subscriber MUST include {'ifModified': true}
         and {'cache': false} (jQuery messes up with headers)!!!

creator: queue id is known but refuses messages with a different suffix
         from first connected client, that is very hard to guess

opponent: queue id includes a random suffix and only creator knows it
